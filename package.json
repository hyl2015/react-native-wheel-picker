  "readme": "# rn-wheel-picker\n\nA iOS style picker components for ReactNative. It's forked from [react-native-wheel-picker](https://github.com/lesliesam/react-native-wheel-picker).\n\n## Introduction\nCross platform Picker component based on React-native.\n\nSince picker is originally supported by ios while Android only supports a ugly Spinner component. If you want to have the same user behaviour, you can use this.\n\nThe android component is based on https://github.com/AigeStudio/WheelPicker which runs super fast and smoothly. It also supports curved effect which make it exactly the same looking and feel as the ios picker.\n![](screenshots/ios1.png)\n![](screenshots/ios2.png)\n\n![](screenshots/android.png)\n\n## How to use\n\nRun command\n\nFor apps using RN 0.32 or higher, please run\n\n```\nnpm i react-native-wheel-picker --save\n```\n\nFor apps using RN 0.31 or less, please run\n\n```\nnpm install --save --save-exact react-native-wheel-picker@1.9.0\n```\n\nConfigration:\n\n```\nreact-native link rn-wheel-picker\n```\n\n## Example code\n\n```\nimport { Picker, DatePicker } from 'rn-wheel-picker'\n\n// use DatePicker\n<DatePicker mode=\"date\" />\n\n// use Picker\n<Picker\n  style={{flex: 1}}\n  selectedValue={1}\n  pickerData={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}\n  onValueChange={(value) => this.setState({value})}\n/>\n```\n",
